# ruffle-demo

ruffle-demo is an example of how to include Ruffle in your website.
It also serves as a nice local test to run Ruffle in the web locally, for developers.

## Using ruffle-demo

### Hosted demo

To view this demo online right now, [check out the hosted demo](https://ruffle.rs/demo).

It's exactly the same code as this directory, updated nightly.

### Run your own demo

After [building ruffle-web](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/blob/master/web/README.md#building-from-source),
you can run `npm run demo` in the `web` folder to launch the demo.

It will start a local web server and print the address in the console.
Navigate to that website (usually [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)) in your browser.

### Configuring the demo

The demo provides the ability to have a list of sample SWFs to choose from.
This can be helpful if you have a list of useful SWFs to test through, and we use it ourselves
to showcase Ruffle on various games or animations.

To use this, add a new file `swfs.json` in this directory. The contents should look like this:

```json
{
  "swfs": [
